Abstract

Dopesick is a 2021 TV Series concerning the opioid crisis in America during the 2000s and its connection to the prescription medicine OxyContin. The series follows many characters in the state of Virginia. One storyline involved a young woman working in a coal mine who hurts her back and ends up addicted to opioids.

By using the generic analytical pipeline introduced in DCU course CA682i; this analysis looks  at the per capita drug transaction rates for the state of Kentucky between 2006 and 2019. This analysis aims to investigate whether there is a relationship between opioid sales and the presence of coal mines. The analysis is on Washington Post Data, US  Census and Population estimates, and Coalfield data for the state of Kentucky. By comparing the top and bottom 10 counties by transaction. The graph suggests that counties in the top 10 most likely have a coalmine, with the converse being true for the bottom ranked.This serves as a good starting point to perform a more detailed analytic project on whether the number of opioid sales could predict the presence of a coalmine or other primary sector work, however such analytic work is outside the scope of this work
